# AdvancedDataVizFinal

## To Run This Project

You will need to install the following packages:
* ggplot2
* tidyr
* dplyr
* ggpubr
* gganimate
* gifski
* transformr

Then, run all the code using the run all choice at the top. The plot that you will see outputted inside of R studio is not reflective of the output you'll see in the animation. The code will add a gif to your folder.

## About the data

The data was collected from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/cause-of-deaths-around-the-world </br>

The data contains yearly historical data by country of counts of the number of people who died from many selected causes. For this project, I focused on the deaths from conflict and terrorism specifically in the US, Iraq, and Afghanistan </br>

## About the visualization

The visualization shows three lines representing cumulative deaths in the US, Iraq, and Afghanistan from 2001-2018. There is also code to produce a gif that shows these deaths climbing over time.

## About the presentation

I added historical markers throughout the animation to allow the viewer to better understand the historical timeline of these events. I included markers that showed the declaration and end of war against both Iraq and Afghanistan during the War on Terror. I added these using www.veed.io., an online video editing tool.
